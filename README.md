# STP releases branch

This branch contains only picked commits that are suitable for my STP school project.

The commits don't correspond to each other.

Each commit should have tag that matches regex `stp-v*` and build workflow for Windows, Linux and MacOS.

Each OS should have at least 1 build.

If you need different arch, build it yourself.
